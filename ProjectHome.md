The project is to develop a virtual machine that runs python in which one can view the byte code instructions executing.

Attempts will be made to run the VM on an AVR or ARM microcontroller as space permits.  The microcontroller VM will be based on the PyMite code base.

Additional tasks shall include a peep hole optimizer on the byte code and new byte code instructions to allow the optimizer to support research into parallelizing the processes.
